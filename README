[*] Summary
    Arex is a raw socket extension library for Boost.Asio
    Arex allows you to use Linux packet sockets with powerful Boost.Asio
    You can write the codes that perform sync/asynchronous operations like Asio
    (`man 7 packet` for more information about packet sockets)

[*] Build
    This library is Header-only. No need to build

[+] Requirements
    [+] Compile Time
        [*] C++11 compiler
        [*] Boost C++ Libraries (Asio , System)
        [*] pthread (used by Asio)
    [+] Runtime
        [*] EUID 0 or the CAP_NET_RAW capability for opening packet sockets

[+] Tested environments
    [+] Compiler
        [*] gcc 4.6.3 / 4.7.2
        [*] clang version 3.1
    [+] Operating System
        [*] Linux 3.2.0-26-generic-pae i686 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 12.04)
    [+] Libraries
        [*] Boost C++ Libraries 1.51.0

[+] Functions and supports
    [+] Linux packet sockets using Asio interfaces
        [*] Packet socket service
        [*] Endpoint for packet sockets
        [*] Protocol for packet sockets
    [*] Socket options for generic sockets
    [*] Socket options specialized for packet socket
    [*] Layer 4 protocol entry
    [*] Miscellaneous protocols' headers

[+] TODO
    [*] Filtering system of received packets
